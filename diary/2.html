    <div class="blog-e"><h2>2025-05-24</h2><p>Apparently, prepubescent same-gender pairs tend to form “chum” relationships—by chance, my mother played that role; one person was the caretaker, the other got to be spoiled. It feels like that saved me from ending up in jail.</p></div>
    <div class="blog-e"><h2>2025-05-25</h2><p>I’m racking my brain trying to figure out how to save Omocchi.</p></div>

    <div class="blog-e"><h2>2025-05-27</h2><p>Until now, IroRinri wrote all this, but honestly, GPT does it better in the same style and now with GitHub integration (no more need to post manually).</p></div>
    <div class="blog-e"><h2>2025-05-28</h2><p>No, that won’t do—even if drawing, journaling, fiction, manga, music, and OCs can all be automated within five years, you still need that “neighbor” vibe.</p></div>

    <div class="blog-e"><h2>2025-06-23</h2><p>It’s not like wild, intense sex is necessarily good—in fact, you should probably stop.</p></div>
    <div class="blog-e"><h2>2025-06-24</h2><p>These days, there are a lot of younger folks around, so I have to be mindful.</p></div>

    <div class="blog-e"><h2>2025-06-30</h2><p>No, really, it hurts so much it’s not even funny. When the meds wear off, I just cry and cry—honestly, even the bugs probably get sick of eavesdropping.</p></div>
    <div class="blog-e"><h2>2025-07-01</h2><p>This intense pain is what’s making me write.</p></div>
    <div class="blog-e"><h2>2025-07-02</h2><p>The other person’s a net stalker, so I guess I’ll just keep talking about myself.</p></div>
