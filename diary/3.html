<div class="blog-e"><h2>2025-07-12</h2><p>AAAHHH!! It really hurts</p></div>
<div class="blog-e"><h2>2025-07-13</h2><p>I’m being forced to act funny — even though I’m not even from Kansai</p></div>
<div class="blog-e"><h2>2025-07-14</h2><p>I want to tell a creepy story on a private boat cruise: Maybe it’s not Google preventing accidents, just that there haven’t been any weird incidents in the last 50 years</p></div>
<div class="blog-e"><h2>2025-07-15</h2><p>GYOOOO!!</p></div>

<div class="blog-e"><h2>2025-07-18</h2><p>It’s impressive how some people can just talk non - stop by themselves…</p></div>

<div class="blog-e"><h2>2025-07-21</h2><p>I went to Fuji - Q alone</p></div>
<div class="blog-e"><h2>2025-07-22</h2><p>All my future selves — millions, billions of me—keep judging my past, asking, “Are you sure this is right?” No matter how much I grow, my younger self always says, “I’m totally right.” I still believe in that kid, but being young is tough… right up to the last second</p></div>
<div class="blog-e"><h2>2025-07-23</h2><p>Sometimes I feel like posting something dramatic on YouTube, like a “sea of red”</p></div>

<div class="blog-e"><h2>2025-07-27</h2><p>Lately, I’ve been calling myself ‘Hyulinade’</p></div>
<div class="blog-e"><h2>2025-07-28</h2><p>I know I can never beat you, so all I can do is focus on what I can do</p></div>
<div class="blog-e"><h2>2025-07-29</h2><p>If you’re tired of lookism, don’t look — but honestly, I feel the same way.</p></div>
<div class="blog-e"><h2>2025-07-30</h2><p>Every single moment is bound up with mortality.</p></div>
<div class="blog-e"><h2>2025-07-31</h2><p>I remember my Japanese tweets going viral just from clumsy fibs.</p></div>
<div class="blog-e"><h2>2025-07-31</h2><p>At some point I started saying dull things just to mess around.</p></div>
<div class="blog-e"><h2>2025-08-01</h2><p>The wish to create beauty is lovely because it’s so transparent.</p></div>
<div class="blog-e"><h2>2025-08-02</h2><p>In the land of the blind, the one-eyed is king.</p></div>

<div class="blog-e"><h2>2025-08-08</h2><p>I love it so much I almost say, “I’ll carry on for ZUN!”?</p></div>
<div class="blog-e"><h2>2025-08-09</h2><p>I don’t know what to do.</p></div>
<div class="blog-e"><h2>2025-08-10</h2><p>I respect myself for enduring heavy pain every day.</p></div>
<div class="blog-e"><h2>2025-08-11</h2><p>All the inner voices miss the point.</p></div>
<div class="blog-e"><h2>2025-08-12</h2><p>I focus on intelligence because as a kid everyone called me dumb.</p></div>
<div class="blog-e"><h2>2025-08-13</h2><p>My existence feels like a burden to both Hatsune Miku and Kasane Teto.</p></div>
<div class="blog-e"><h2>2025-08-14</h2><p>Drenched in red.</p></div>
<div class="blog-e"><h2>2025-08-15</h2><p>No matter how hot it is, being in just underwear stirs up urges, so I wear sweats instead.</p></div>
<div class="blog-e"><h2>2025-08-16</h2><p>It’s surprising people are still criticizing AI art.</p></div>
<div class="blog-e"><h2>2025-08-17</h2><p>A dream where I pretended to be a tough kid but walked to school alone.</p></div>
<div class="blog-e"><h2>2025-08-18</h2><p>Maybe I lost motivation for 3DCG because the pixel art in Yume Nikki is so cute.</p></div>
<div class="blog-e"><h2>2025-08-19</h2><p>Color ethics is a left-hander, so it’s L1 shooting.</p></div>
<div class="blog-e"><h2>2025-08-20</h2><p>They say to forget the past, that holding on only exhausts you, and that you should think about your future self.</p></div>
<div class="blog-e"><h2>2025-08-21</h2><p>I might need some kind of cleansing ritual.</p></div>
<div class="blog-e"><h2>2025-08-22</h2><p>Friend…</p></div>
<div class="blog-e"><h2>2025-08-23</h2><p>The world… is letting me fade away…</p></div>
<div class="blog-e"><h2>2025-08-25</h2><p>Unpaid creative overtime might be as harmful as anti-AI art. Still, “Give, and it will be given to you.” —Luke 6:38</p></div>
<div class="blog-e"><h2>2025-08-26</h2><p>I want Irorin to stay on the playful (player) side forever.</p></div>
<div class="blog-e"><h2>2025-08-27</h2><p>Comparing the earnings I could’ve had by continuing AI art with the trust I gained by quitting (around 20 subscribers lost… lol), it looks like a clear blunder.</p></div>
