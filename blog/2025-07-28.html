Hey everyone!<br>
I’m excited to share my new AItuber, Laavie—a character inspired by the sea, with a calm vibe and blue colors like gentle waves.<br>
<br>
Creating Laavie was a lot of fun. I imagined her as a wise, peaceful figure with the timeless feel of the ocean. I played with shades of blue and flowing shapes to capture that look.<br>
<br>
Now that she’s finished, I hope Laavie can bring a bit of ocean calm to everyone. Next, I want to make her more interactive and expressive.<br>
Thanks for reading!<br>
See you next time!
