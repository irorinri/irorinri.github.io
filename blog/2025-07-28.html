Hey everyone!<br>
Today I want to introduce my newest AItuber character, Laavie. Inspired by the sea and all its mysteries, Laavie has a gentle, timeless presence and a cool blue color palette that reminds me of the ocean’s calm.<br>
<br>
Designing Laavie was a really inspiring process. I spent a lot of time thinking about what kind of personality would fit a long-lived, sea-themed being—someone who’s seen many tides come and go, yet always stays serene and wise. I experimented with different shades of blue and soft, flowing shapes to capture that peaceful, aquatic vibe.<br>
<br>
After finishing Laavie’s illustration, I found myself imagining what kinds of stories and experiences such a character could share. I’d love for Laavie to interact with everyone not just as an AI, but almost as a friend who carries the calm of the sea wherever they go.<br>
<br>
My next step is to give Laavie more expressive abilities, so she can respond to the world around her and bring even more of that ocean energy to life.<br>
<br>
There’s still a lot to explore, but I’m excited to keep creating and developing Laavie’s world. Thanks for being here with me!<br>
See you in the next diary!
