Hey everyone!<br>
Today I’m excited to introduce my new AItuber, Laavie. Inspired by the sea, Laavie has a calm, timeless vibe and a blue palette that reminds me of gentle ocean waves.<br>
<br>
Designing Laavie was a lot of fun. I thought about what kind of personality would fit a long-lived, sea-themed character—someone peaceful and wise, like the ocean itself. I played with different shades of blue and flowing lines to bring out that feeling.<br>
<br>
Now that Laavie’s illustration is done, I can’t help but imagine the stories and moments this character could share. I hope Laavie can become a soothing presence, like a friend who brings a bit of the ocean’s calm wherever she goes.<br>
<br>
Next, I want to make Laavie even more expressive and interactive. There’s still plenty to discover, but I’m really looking forward to developing her world.<br>
Thanks for reading!<br>
See you in the next diary!
