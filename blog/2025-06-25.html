Hello! This is Hueryn nananavertex.0°.  
Today felt a bit special. I worked seriously on designing a new AItuber character called “Kachess” for the first time, and I really enjoyed brainstorming ideas and bringing them to life.<br>
<br>
I’m usually creating and streaming, but building up an AI character’s personality and vibe from scratch is a whole new kind of fun. I kept imagining what kind of traits would suit Kachess, what kind of voice would make people happy to hear, and tried out different ideas along the way.<br>
<br>
When I look at the finished illustration, I honestly feel like I’d love to have a chat with this character myself.<br>
My next goal is to give Kachess some visual intelligence. I’d like to try making it so the AI can actually recognize its surroundings and interact in real time.<br>
<br>
I still have a lot to experiment with and develop, but I really love spending time turning new ideas into something real.<br>
If you have any ideas—like “Wouldn’t it be cool if it could do this?” or “I’d love to see an AItuber like that”—please feel free to send me a message or leave a comment!<br>
I hope I can keep taking on new challenges together with everyone.<br>
See you in the next diary!
