Hey everyone!<br>
Today felt a little special—I spent some real, focused time designing a new AItuber character named Kachess. It was so much fun coming up with ideas and actually turning them into something on the page.<br>
<br>
I’m used to making content and streaming, but building up an AI character’s whole personality and vibe from scratch is a totally different kind of creative challenge. I kept imagining what traits would suit Kachess, what sort of voice would make people smile, and played around with lots of possibilities.<br>
<br>
Honestly, after finishing the illustration, I found myself wishing I could have a real conversation with this character!<br>
Next up, I want to give Kachess some visual intelligence—so it can actually recognize its surroundings and interact in real time. That’s my new goal.<br>
<br>
There’s still so much left to experiment with and figure out, but I really love the process of turning fresh ideas into something real.  
I hope I can keep taking on new challenges together with all of you.<br>
See you in the next diary!
