Hey there, friends!<br>
Today, I finally held my own self-published doujinshi (fan-made comic book) in my hands for the first time!<br>
<br>
It’s still only four pages, so it’s super thin—honestly, it almost feels like holding a flyer (haha).<br>
But getting to see my drawings and story printed as a real book made me genuinely happy.<br>
<br>
I chose the cover art myself, but after seeing the printed result, I think a matte finish might actually look better than the glossy PP cover I used this time.<br>
<br>
If you’re interested, you can pick up a copy from my online art gallery anytime.<br>
It’s just a small start, but I’m excited to keep drawing and add more pages little by little.<br>
Thank you so much for supporting my creative journey!
