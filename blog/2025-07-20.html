Hey there, friends!<br>
Today I got to hold a printed copy of my own doujinshi (self-published comic book) for the very first time!<br>
<br>
It’s only four pages long, so it’s incredibly thin—honestly, it feels more like a flyer than a book. Still, there’s something really special about seeing my artwork and story turned into a real, physical book.<br>
<br>
I picked out the cover art myself, but after seeing it in print, I think a matte finish might suit it better than the glossy PP cover I chose this time.<br>
<br>
If you’re curious, you can grab a copy anytime from my online art gallery.<br>
It’s just the beginning, but I’m looking forward to drawing more and slowly adding new pages.<br>
Thanks so much for cheering me on!
