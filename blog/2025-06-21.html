Hey everyone!<br>
Today I finally took the first real step toward a dream I’ve had for ages—playing shogi against an AI! I started building my own shogi app in Unity.<br>
<br>
To be honest, the pieces can’t even move yet. But just setting up the board and placing each piece by hand gave me this little spark of excitement—like, “This is where it all begins.”<br>
<br>
I’ve loved shogi ever since I was a kid. There’s just something magical about the sound of the pieces landing on the board, the tension at the start of a match, and those wild moments when a single move turns the whole game upside down. I love everything about it.<br>
<br>
So even though I’m still just getting started, creating my own “living shogi” feels genuinely fun and meaningful. One day, I hope I’ll be able to play a match with all of you on this AI-powered board!<br>
I’m going to keep moving forward at my own pace—thanks so much for cheering me on!
