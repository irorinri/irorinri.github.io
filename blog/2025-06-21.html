Hello! This is Huelin.<br>
Today, I finally took the first step toward my long-time dream of playing shogi against an AI—I started building my own shogi app in Unity!<br>
<br>
That said, the pieces can’t even move yet (haha).<br>
But when I made the board and carefully placed each piece by hand, I felt this little spark of excitement—like, “This is where it all begins.”<br>
<br>
I’ve loved shogi since I was a kid. There’s something special about the sound of the pieces as you set them on the board, the tension of the opening moves, and those thrilling moments when a single move completely changes the flow of the game. I love everything about it.<br>
<br>
That’s why, even though I’m just getting started, building my own “living shogi” feels truly fun and meaningful. Someday, I hope I’ll get to play a match with you all on this AI-powered board!<br>
I’ll keep moving forward at my own pace—thanks so much for cheering me on!
