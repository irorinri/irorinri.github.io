Hey everyone!<br>
Today I finally took the first real step toward a dream I’ve had for ages—playing shogi against an AI!<br>
<br>
I managed to get a shogi board working in Unity, and I’m now testing out the basic piece placements.<br>
<br>
It’s still a work in progress (and looks pretty rough), but it’s exciting to see the board on my screen and imagine future games.<br>
<br>
Eventually, I want to make a shogi AI strong enough to challenge me, and maybe even share the finished project online.<br>
<br>
Thanks for following along with my journey!
